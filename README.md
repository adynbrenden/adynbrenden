# Hello. Adyn Brenden here!
## An 8-Bit Zoomer
I'm a guy who takes interest in older tech and who finds joy in the torture that is writing whole walls of code without testing :'3 . I have ambitions to create at least one operating system but am consumed by my pursuit of cartooning and other people's projects. 
## My Current Obsessions
- Vixenion!
- Shavian Keyboard?
- The Dragon Tamers!!! (Current comic project)
- Forte (Musical new social app)
- Adyn.NeoCities.org (Official site WIP)
