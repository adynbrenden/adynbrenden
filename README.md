# Hello. Adyn Brenden here!
## An 8-Bit Zoomer
I'm a guy who takes interest in older tech and who finds joy in the torture that is writing whole walls of code without testing :') . I have ambitions to create at least one operating system but am consumed by my pursuit of cartooning and everchanging interests/ideas. 
## My Current Obsessions
- Vixenion!
- Shavian Keyboard?
- The Dragon Tamers!!! (Current comic project)
- CUBIX (Mineclone)
- My Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ScottyBrenden (Nothing about coding here, just fluffy comix. lol)
