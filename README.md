# Hello. Adyn Brenden here!
## The Fluffy Cartoonist (among Other Things)
I'm a fun male who occasionally gets inspired to do random code projects. I have ambitions to create at least one operating system and probably some games, but for now, I'm just a casual CS Student.
## My Current Obsessions
- Pixi.JS and Javascript for my horny webgame.
- A simple, pool game-board app for my dad
- GameBoy assemblr!!
- My Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ScottyBrenden (Nothing about coding here, just horny cartoons. lol)
