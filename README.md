## Some Unfortunate News
I was once blessed with a full ride scholarship at an elite college, but ever since I made satyrical illustrations on a mural intended for sharing mine and other views creatively, I have been outright villified. This included being falsely arrested, illegally forced out of my dorm, defamed on national news, and openly mocked in front of my peers in a sham hearing to officiate my expulsion. This is not an issue about whether you agree with my opinions, this is an issue about academic freedom and freedom of expression, two principles that America depends upon in order to continue to grow and build a better world with each passing generation. The college failed to engage satire (a protected form of speech) as a teaching moment, but instead jumped straight to destroying both the satire and the creator. **This is absolutely unacceptable behavior that we must firmly denounce.** I've begun the process to see that justice is served, but I need your help too.
