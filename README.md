# Hello. Adyn Brenden here!
## Furry Catholic and Cartoonist
I'm a fun male who occasionally gets inspired to do random code projects. I have ambitions to create at least one operating system and probably some games, but for now, I'm just a casual CS Student.
## My Current Obsessions
- Pixi.JS and Javascript for my horny webgame.
- Python and dhooks for a custom discord pluralkit
- C++ (but I still love C!)
- My comic: https://jackoverdrive.cfw.me/
- Weekly CS Projects
